# Shared Task Acquisition Modeling - Duolingo challenge

Our solution relies on Knowledge Tracing Machines:

	@inproceedings{Vie2019,
	  Author = {{Vie}, Jill-J{\^e}nn and {Kashima}, Hisashi},
	  Booktitle = {Proceedings of the 33th {AAAI} Conference on Artificial Intelligence},
	  Title = {{Knowledge Tracing Machines: Factorization Machines for Knowledge Tracing}},
	  Pages = {750--757},
	  Url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03388},
	  Year = 2019}

To be precise, at the time of the competition our solution relied on Deep Factorization Machines, but in the meantime Knowledge Tracing Machines proved to be less prone to overfitting.
